# curses-map-generator
This map generator is quite slow and not optimized. Maps larger than 300 may take very long times to create.

To use the program:
```
python3 maps.py # make sure the directories exist or permissions to make new directories exist
```

Controls:
```
move left   - a (or left arrow)
move right  - d (or right arrow)
move up     - w (or up arrow)
move down   - s (or down arrow)
exit map    - ctrl + c
```
